        We first met in August 2014 when we exchanged journals during our 11
        a.m. English 101 class at UNCC. In a matter of weeks, we transitioned
        from being classmates to close friends, and eventually became lovers.
        It's incredible to reflect on the fact that it has been 9 years. We
        consider ourselves incredibly fortunate to share our love with all of
        you and are so excited to join together as husband and wife. The
        ceremony is scheduled for 11 a.m. On the morning of June 15, 2024, 5320
        Whites Rd, Jamestown, NC 27282. Kindly RSVP by March 1st, 2024 via email
        at julieandwalker@gmail.com. The complete wedding schedule and parking
        details will be provided here and sent via email on May 1st. As we
        embark on our journey to Georgia and take on the role of first-time
        homeowners this year, we have curated a registry list. We will be
        renovating and updating a home in Griffin, GA, and have compiled a list
        of kitchen items, tools, small appliances, and furniture. Our
        comprehensive list can be found at:
