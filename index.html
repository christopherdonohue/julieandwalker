              and we are profoundly grateful to have you in our lives. We look

          <h4 class="gray-underline">Our Story</h4>
          <p>
            We first met in August 2014 when we exchanged journals during our 11
            a.m. English 101 class at UNCC. In a matter of weeks, we
            transitioned from being classmates to close friends, and eventually
            lovers. It's incredible to reflect on the fact that it has been 9
            years. We consider ourselves incredibly blessed to share our love
            with all of you and are so excited to join together as husband and
            wife.

          <h4 class="gray-underline">Registry</h4>
          <p>
            In 2024 we plan on buying and updating our first home. We have
            compiled a list of kitchen items, tools, small appliances, and
            furniture that we will need as we begin our journey.
          </p>
