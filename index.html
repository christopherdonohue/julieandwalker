            Our Story
          </h4>
          <p>
            We first met in August 2014 when we exchanged journals during our 11
            a.m. English 101 class at UNCC. In a matter of weeks, we
            transitioned from being classmates to close friends, and eventually
            became lovers. It's incredible to reflect on the fact that it has
            been 9 years. We consider ourselves incredibly fortunate to share
            our love with all of you and are so excited to join together as
            husband and wife.

            Registry
          </h4>
          <p>
            As we embark on our journey to Georgia and take on the role of
            first-time homeowners this year, we have curated a registry list. We
            will be renovating and updating a home in Griffin, GA, and have
            compiled a list of kitchen items, tools, small appliances, and
            furniture.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our comprehensive list can be found here:
